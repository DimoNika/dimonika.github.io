### Story

I chose to design my portfolio on **Vue.js** framework because it is popular powerful frontend tool. I spent a lot of time getting into it, but i developed quite some understanding and skills in it.

This is built version but you cant see it in raw [here](https://github.com/DimoNika/DimoFolio).

Now I am able to develope some simple Vue pages.


### How to use

To launch project in developing mode navigate to [this](https://github.com/DimoNika/DimoFolio) repo and work with it as it is usual vue app.
